And if you'd like to get the repository for the Hangman game just go to [this link](https://github.com/jdsoteldo/hangman-game) and clone it using the same commands you used to clone this repo!

Feel free to clone the repo, change it, fork it, keep building on top of what I provided and customize the code in any way, shape or form you wish.
